That’s typical folder structure in Android Studio. 
Next we create directory cpp inside main folder, 
and then create CMakeLists.txt. 
If you’re not familiar with CMakeLists.txt find out more here and here.

CMakeLists.txtDefault

1   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.7)
2	add_library(hello-jni SHARED hello-jni.c)
3	target_link_libraries(hello-jni log android)

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.7) means we need minimum version 2.8.7 of cmake. It depends on what you need in your project. by default Android Studio built in CMake version is 3.4.1
add_library(hello-jni SHARED hello-jni.c) means we create shared library named hello-jni with hello-jni.c as  source.
target_link_libraries(hello-jni log android) means we link library needed by hello-jni, in this case log and android.\
